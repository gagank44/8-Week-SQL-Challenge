 D. Pricing and Ratings
1.If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes 
- how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

SELECT 
    '$' || SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
            ELSE 10
        END
    ) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    customer_orders
JOIN 
    pizza_names ON customer_orders.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id
JOIN 
    runner_orders ON runner_orders.order_id = customer_orders.order_id
WHERE 
    runner_orders.cancellation IS NULL;


2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?Add cheese is $1 extra


3.The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner,
 how would you design an additional table for this new dataset -
 generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings 
 for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
 
 CREATE TABLE ratings 
 (order_id INTEGER,
    rating INTEGER);
INSERT INTO ratings
 (order_id ,rating)
VALUES 
(1,3),
(2,4),
(3,5),
(4,2),
(5,1),
(6,3),
(7,4),
(8,1),
(9,3),
(10,5); 
SELECT * from ratings
 
 
 
4.Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a 
table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
customer_id
order_id
runner_id
rating
order_time
pickup_time
Time between order and pickup
Delivery duration
Average speed
Total number of pizzas

SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.order_id, 
    r.runner_id, 
    r2.rating, 
    c.order_time, 
    r.pickup_time, 
    ROUND((JULIANDAY(r.pickup_time) - JULIANDAY(c.order_time)) * 24 * 60, 2) AS Time__order_pickup, 
    r.duration, 
    ROUND(AVG(r.distance / r.duration * 60), 2) AS avg_speed, 
    COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS Pizza_Count
FROM 
    customer_orders c
LEFT JOIN 
    runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id 
LEFT JOIN 
    ratings r2 ON c.order_id = r2.order_id
WHERE 
    r.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.runner_id, r2.rating, c.order_time, r.pickup_time, r.duration
ORDER BY 
    c.customer_id;



5If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and
 each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have 
 left over after these deliveries?
 
 with cte as(
select 
cu.order_id,
sum(case when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' THEN 12
else 10 end )as pizza_price
from pizza_names n
join customer_orders cu on cu.pizza_id = n.pizza_id
group by cu.order_id
)
select  
sum(cte.pizza_price) as revenue,
sum( r.distance*0.3) as total_cost,
sum(cte.pizza_price) - sum( r.distance*0.3) as profit
from  runner_orders r 
join cte on r.order_id = cte.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
