       B. Runner and Customer Experience
1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

SELECT 
  STRFTIME('%W', registration_date) AS registration_week,
  COUNT(runner_id) AS runner_signup
FROM 
  runners
GROUP BY 
  STRFTIME('%W', registration_date);


2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

SELECT 
    runner_id,
    AVG((JULIANDAY(pickup_time) - JULIANDAY(order_time)) * 24 * 60) AS avg_time_hq
FROM 
    runner_orders
JOIN 
    customer_orders ON customer_orders.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
GROUP BY 
    runner_id;

	
3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

WITH prep_time_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    c.order_id, 
    COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_order, 
     
    (JULIANDAY(r.pickup_time) - JULIANDAY(c.order_time)) * 24 * 60 AS prep_time_minutes
  FROM 
    customer_orders AS c
  JOIN 
    runner_orders AS r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
  WHERE 
    r.distance != 0
  GROUP BY 
    c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)
SELECT 
  pizza_order, 
  AVG(prep_time_minutes) AS avg_prep_time_minutes
FROM 
  prep_time_cte

GROUP BY 
  pizza_order;


4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

SELECT c.customer_id, AVG(r.distance) AS avg_distance
FROM customer_orders AS c
JOIN runner_orders AS r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;


5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS delivery_time_difference
FROM runner_orders
where duration is not null



6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

speed=distance/time(duration)

select order_id,avg(distance/duration*60) as speed
from runner_orders
where duration is not null
group by order_id

7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

SELECT 
  runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(
    CASE WHEN distance = 0 THEN 0
    ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS success_perc
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
